#### About me

I am a medical student at Imperial College London studying for an intercalated BSc Cardiovascular Sciences degree. I am interested in the application of mathematical and computational modelling to medical problems.

### Current Research

My ongoing research project involves designing novel deep learning architectures for future risk prediction using ECGs (with Dr. Arun Sau and Dr. Fu Siong Ng).


I have previous experience in the computational modelling of cardiac electrophysiological dynamics (in particular fibrillation) and its analysis using adapted information-theoretic methods (with Dr. Marta Varela and Dr. Pedro Mediano).

### Skills and Proficiencies

I am proficient in Python, R and MATLAB.

My broad interests cover physics, statistics and machine learning, as well as medical topics including cardiology and epidemiology. I previously held a place to study MSCi Physics with Theoretical Physics at Imperial, before switching to MBBS/BSc.

### Leadership and Extracurriculars

I am currently Co-President for the ICSM Coding Society, which aims to help medical students learn to code.


Other than academics, I am interested in philosophy, music (classical and jazz) and I play the piano.
