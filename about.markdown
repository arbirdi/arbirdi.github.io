I am a medical student at Imperial College London studying for an intercalated BSc Cardiovascular Sciences degree. I am interested in the application of mathematical and computational modelling to medical problems.
My most recent project involves designing AI algorithms for future risk prediction using ECGs (with Dr. Arun Sau and Dr. Fu Siong Ng).
I have previous experience in the computational modelling of cardiac electrophysiological dynamics (in particular fibrillation) and its analysis using adapted information-theoretic methods (with Dr. Marta Varela and Dr. Pedro Mediano).
I am proficient in Python, R and MATLAB.
My broad interests cover physics, statistics and machine learning. I previously held a place to study MSCi Physics with Theoretical Physics at Imperial, before switching to MBBS/BSc.
I am currently Co-President for the ICSM Coding Society, which aims to help medical students learn to code.
Other than academics, I am interested in philosophy, music (classical and jazz) and I play the piano.
